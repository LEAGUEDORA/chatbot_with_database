# chatbot_with_database
This is a chatbot developed with Flask and sqlite3 

This chatbot is developed by:

Aremanda Abhijeeth (19Pa1a0508)
Allu Daddy Durga Praveen (19Pa1a0503)
Boyinapalli Sandeep Dora (19Pa1a0521)


This is a very useful chat bot developed to check PUBG players profile, reporting players etc.,
These pages are added with a AI bot that cananswer any question related to the content of the webpages.
This bot generates a link that takes you to the reqired page to solve your problem.


What's New🧐:
  1. Added a 10,000 players data base, so that randomly generated dosenot occur.
  2. Added a Login page so that no random player can report.
  3. We made our bot more smarter by adding more intents. 



Disclaimer: Since Heroku doesn't support external links for the chatterbot module that also can help the user taking to their destination precisely.
So we added two videos here inorder to show the proof that we did an AI chatterbot.Please consider this as our humble request.😫😫😫
